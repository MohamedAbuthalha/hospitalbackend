| **Staff**   | (Future) Nurses, receptionists, lab staff    |
| **Patient** | Created via intake / triage                  |

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose
* **Auth**: JWT
* **Architecture**: MVC + Services + Utilities
* **Status**: Backend v1 Complete ✅

---

## 🧠 Smart Triage Engine

Patients are **not manually tagged** with severity or specialization.

Instead, the system analyzes symptoms using a **rule-based triage service**.

### Example:

```text
Symptoms: "Chest pain and sweating"
→ Severity: critical
→ Specialization: cardiology
→ Emergency: true
```

### Triage Logic:

* Keyword-based medical rules
* Explainable decisions (not black-box AI)
* AI-ready for future upgrades

---

## ⚖️ Priority Scoring Logic

Each patient case gets a **dynamic priority score**:

```
Priority = Severity Weight + Waiting Time
```

| Severity | Score |
| -------- | ----- |
| Critical | +100  |
| Medium   | +50   |
| Low      | +0    |

Waiting time adds up to **60 extra points**.

This ensures:

* Critical patients are handled first
* Long-waiting patients are never starved

---

## 👨‍⚕️ Auto Doctor Assignment

When a patient case is created:

1. Triage determines **severity & specialization**
2. System finds **on-duty doctors**
3. Filters doctors who are **under capacity**
4. Sorts by:

   * Least active cases
   * Highest experience
5. Assigns the case automatically

If no doctor is available:

* Case stays in **waiting queue**
* Gets auto-assigned when a doctor becomes free

---

## 🔄 Waiting Queue & Re-assignment

When a doctor completes a case:

* Their workload is reduced
* The system automatically assigns the **next highest-priority waiting case**
* No manual intervention needed

This mimics real hospital triage flow.

---

## 📊 Doctor Dashboard

Doctors can:

* View assigned cases
* See statistics:

  * Total cases
  * Active cases
  * Completed cases
  * Critical cases
* Update case status:

  * `assigned → in-treatment → completed`
* Toggle **ON / OFF duty**

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT-based authentication
* Middleware-level role enforcement
* Secure routes for:

  * Admin
  * Doctor
  * Staff

Example:

```js
authorize("doctor")
```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/hospital_management
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Expected output:

```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication System (COMPLETED)

### Key Rules

* First admin registers once
* Public registration disabled permanently
* All other users created by admin
* JWT required for all protected routes

### Login

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

### Frontend Usage

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

---

## 👥 User & Role System (COMPLETED)

### User Model (Single Source of Truth)

```js
User {
  name
  email
  password (hashed)
  role (admin | doctor | nurse | lab | ward | pharmacist | receptionist)
  isActive
}
```

### Why this matters

* Simple permissions
* Easy audits
* Scales cleanly

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Admin Module (COMPLETED)

Admin can:

* Create doctors
* Create staff (non-doctor)
* View all staff
* Activate / deactivate users

### Example

```
POST /api/admin/staff
```

```json
{
  "name": "Dr John",
  "email": "john@hospital.com",
  "password": "Admin@123",
  "role": "doctor"
}
```

---

## 🏥 Patient Case Management (COMPLETED)

```
POST /api/patients
```

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 45,
  "gender": "male",
  "symptoms": "chest pain and breathing difficulty"
}
```

Automatically triggers:

* Triage
* Severity calculation
* Required specialization

---

## 🧠 Rule-Based Triage Engine (COMPLETED)

📁 `services/triage.service.js`

Outputs:

```json
{
  "severity": "critical",
  "specialization": "cardiology",
  "emergency": true
}
```

✔ Deterministic
✔ Explainable
✔ AI-upgradable later

---

## 🤖 Automatic Doctor Assignment (COMPLETED)

📁 `services/autoAssign.service.js`

Assignment rules:

1. Match specialization
2. Ignore inactive or full doctors
3. Sort by:

   * Least active cases
   * Highest experience
4. Assign case
5. Increment workload

Safe, race-condition free.

---

## 🧪 System Health

```
GET /health
```

```json
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

---

## ❗ Critical Rules (DO NOT BREAK)

* Doctor profiles created only by admin
* One doctor = one user
* No assignment inside models
* All logic stays in services
* Controllers stay thin

---

## ❌ Known Pitfalls (Already Fixed)

* await outside async
* Express handler crashes
* Duplicate imports
* Password mismatches
* Broken JWT guards

---

## 🧭 Pending Phases (WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT)

### 🔜 Phase 1 – Case Completion Flow

```

---

## 5️⃣ TRIAGE SYSTEM (MAJOR CHANGE)

### ❌ REMOVED

* Hardcoded triage logic inside controllers

---

### ✅ ADDED (HYBRID SYSTEM)

#### Rule-Based Triage Engine

* Located in:

```
src/services/triage.rules.js
src/services/triage.engine.js
```

#### How it works:

* Matches symptoms to keywords
* Assigns:

  * severity
  * specialization
* Uses confidence threshold
* Deterministic (same input → same output)

#### Example:

```
"chest pain + sweating" → cardiology | critical
```

---

### 🤖 AI TRIAGE

* **PLANNED**
* NOT ACTIVE
* Will only run when rules are uncertain
* Rules always override AI

---

## 6️⃣ DOCTOR ASSIGNMENT LOGIC

### ✅ CURRENT

* Auto-assigned only if:

  * specialization matches
  * doctor is on duty
  * doctor capacity allows

### 🚫 AI CANNOT ASSIGN DOCTORS

---

## 7️⃣ CASE LIFE CYCLE

```
Patient creates case
     ↓
Triage engine assigns severity + specialization
     ↓
Doctor auto-assigned OR waiting
     ↓
Nurse records vitals
     ↓
Doctor treats
     ↓
Doctor marks case complete
```

---

## 8️⃣ DATABASE ENTITIES (CURRENT)

### User

* name
* email
* password
* role (admin | doctor | nurse)

### DoctorProfile

* specialization
* department
* experience
* maxCases
* activeCases
* isOnDuty

### PatientCase

---

### 🌱 LOW PRIORITY / FUTURE

8. Patient portal
9. Notifications (email/SMS)
10. Frontend (React)
11. ML model training
12. Multi-hospital support

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ DESIGN RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

🚨 These are **non-negotiable**:

* No staff self-registration
* Admin creates staff only
* Rules > AI
* AI never assigns doctors
* Controllers stay thin
* Logic lives in services
* Role checks on every route

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ WHAT THIS SYSTEM CAN DO TODAY

✅ Handle real patient triage
✅ Assign correct doctors
✅ Track patient cases
✅ Scale with more rules
✅ Add AI safely later
✅ Pass backend interviews

This is **production-grade architecture**, not a demo.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ HANDOVER MESSAGE FOR NEXT AI 🤖

> This is a Node.js hospital management backend with rule-based triage and role-based access.
> Rules are deterministic and must always override AI.
> Admin creates staff, patients are public, doctors treat cases.
> Any new feature must respect existing role boundaries and triage confidence logic.

---

## 🏁 NEXT SAFE STEP
